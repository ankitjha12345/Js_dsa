<h1>What is Data Structure</h1>
<h3>==> Way to organize data so that we can use this efficienlty</h3>
  Example 
    [8,5,5,2,4,9,2]
    [0,1,2,2,3,4,5]

What is Algorithm
  ==> Steps or a process to arrange data.


Data Structrue
  ==> Primitive Data Structure 
      
      => Integer
      => Float
      => Charcter
      => Pointer
 
 ==> Non-Primitive Data Structure   
     
     => Arrays
     => Lists
     
        => Linear Lists
        
          => Stacks
          => Queues

        => Non-Linear Lists
          
          => Graphs
          => Trees
          
     => Files
